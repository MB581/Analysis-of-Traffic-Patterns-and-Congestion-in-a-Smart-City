## **Project Overview**

### **Introduction**  
With rapid urbanization, managing traffic efficiently in smart cities has become critical to enhancing mobility, reducing congestion, and improving the overall quality of urban life. This project focuses on analyzing traffic patterns and congestion using a dataset that captures diverse parameters, such as vehicle types, weather conditions, economic states, time of day, and traffic density. 

The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights to aid city planners in implementing sustainable and adaptive traffic management strategies.

### **Key Objectives**  
1. Identify patterns and trends in traffic flow across various cities.  
2. Examine how external factors (e.g., weather, economic conditions, random events) influence traffic congestion.  
3. Propose actionable recommendations for enhancing traffic management and city mobility.
